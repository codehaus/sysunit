<h1>Issues</h1>
<h2>Event based tests</h2>

<p>Right now there's no way to terminate the test if some timeout
expires - having a 'timeout TBean' could do that maybe?</p>

<p>We need a way for the run() method to not block indefinitely. Using
an event based approach rather than a blocking run() method would be
nice - but then that can be a kind of TBean, where the run() method
waits for a period of time until some event occurs.
Or we could use the <i>composite</i> pattern where a single TBean could
create a number of event based TBeans and the run() method of the
composite TBean could just wait for all the child TBeans to complete.</p>
