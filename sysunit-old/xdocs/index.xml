<section name="SysUnit">

<p>
	SysUnit is a JUnit framework for distributed unit testing. 
	SysUnit is particularly well suited to system testing and integration testing
	or the unit testing of any highly distributed system using web applications, 
	web services or JMS / MOM systems.
</p>

<p>
	The idea behind SysUnit is that a single unit test is made up of a number of
	<i>TBean</i> objects. A TBean is to SysUnit what an MBean is to JMX. A TBean is
	a single JavaBean used for testing which is usually remote. 
	A SysUnit test will create a number of TBeans,
	run them and then perform some validation to ensure that the test worked.
</p>
	
<subsection name="Lifecycle">
<p>
	The typical lifecycle of a SysUnit test is
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		create a number of TBeans, usually remotely by deploying some WAR/EAR/SAR
		in some remote server or executing some remote Ant/Jelly script
	</li>
	<li>
		foreach TBean call setUp() to initialise the TBean ready for use
	</li>
	<li>
		foreach TBean call run() in parallel to execute each TBean
	</li>
	<li>
		foreach TBean call assertValid() method to check the TBean was succesful
	</li>
	<li>
		perform any SysUnit validation across the TBeans
	</li>
</ul>
