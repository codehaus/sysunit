<h2>How does a distributed test work?</h2>

<p> A number of TBeans are created, setup and then ran in parallel. The
JUnit test then waits until they all finish (or terminate with some
error). Then each TBean is validated with the assertValid() method. Then
the SysUnit test is validated via the assertValid() method.</p>

<h2>How do I write a SysUnit test?</h2>

<p> Create a TBean implementation which does something. This could be a
remote MBean, web service, Session bean invocation, a JMS producer or
consumer etc.</p>

<p>Then create a JUnit test case by deriving from <b>SysUnitSupport</b>
and then implement the following method</p>

<pre>createTBeans()</pre>

<p>creating new TBean implementations and calling addTBean(TBean)
method to register the new tbean.</p>
<p>Thats all you need to do. Then if you want to perform any post-run
analysis to check TBeans are in the correct state (such as to check the
consistency of each TBean or whatever), overload the following method to
do whatever checks you need...</p>

<pre>assertValid()</pre>

<p>This method can be implemented either inside your SysUnit TestCase
to do cross-TBean validation or inside a specific TBean.</p>
