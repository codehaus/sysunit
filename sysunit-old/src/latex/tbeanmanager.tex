\chapter{\indexclass{TBeanManager}}

\section{Introduction}

SysUnit tests are created to coordinate multiple threads of
execution.  There is no constraint that all threads of execution
must execution within a single process or even a single machine.
The \class{TBeanManager} is a pluggable strategy to allow for
the creation, execution, synchronization and coordination of 
\class{TBean} instances in various environments.  It is
never necessary for test implementors to concern themselves
with \class{TBeanManager} instances.  It is purely an implementation
class within the core of SysUnit. 

The \class{TBeanManager} may be selected using the 
\texttt{org.sysunit.TBeanManager} system-property.

\section{\indexclass{LocalTBeanManager}}

The \indexclass{LocalTBeanManager} is the default \class{TBeanManager}
and runs all system \class{TBean} instances within a single JVM.

\begin{implnote}
So far, only \class{LocalTBeanManager} exists, due to previous
problems attempting to use JBoss to create a
\class{RemoteTBeanManager}.  Will either attempt a go with
mx4j or possibly just a custom-rolled test-cluster node daemon
that provides classloader isolation.
