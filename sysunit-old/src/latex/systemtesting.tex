\chapter{System Testing}

Unit tests are by definition tests that verify the operation
of a \emph{unit} of code.  There is no absolute strict definition
of unit but most view a unit to be equivalent to a single 
implementation class.  In some instances, though, a unit may be
composed of multiple classes within a package.  

When testing the interactions of multiple units, you have
graudated to \emph{system testing}, which may verify
more complex behaviour of the system.  Many times system
testing requires concurrently executing several bits of code,
synchronizing their execution, and verifying the results
across the entire environment.

More description about how to write good system-tests is 
needed here.  Examples, etc.
